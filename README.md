## Challenges

In the future, we have the following challenges:

- If we go with Krisp, that means people must use Krisp
- Process audio/transcripts in big amounts (it requires a lot of processing)
- Costs: this could take a lot of money from us, maybe we can go with an offline model
- Efficiency: We need to make the model more efficient to consider better chunks of the text
